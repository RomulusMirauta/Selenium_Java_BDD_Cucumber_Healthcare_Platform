mvn package
builds Maven project and creates a distributable file (like a .jar or .war) in the target directory.
-It compiles code.
-Runs tests.
-Packages the compiled code and resources into a JAR/WAR.

check pom.xml for deps & update if needed

mvn install
command builds Maven project and installs the resulting artifact (JAR/WAR) into local Maven repository (~/.m2/repository).
It also downloads and installs all dependencies specified in pom.xml.

mvn test
command runs all the tests in Maven project (usually in src/test/java).
It compiles test code, executes unit and integration tests, and reports results.
Use it to verify code works as expected and that all tests pass.

AppTest.java is a Java test class, typically generated by Maven when you create a new project using the maven-archetype-quickstart archetype.

Its purpose is to provide a basic example of a unit test for your project.
You can use it to write and run tests that verify your code works as expected.
It usually contains simple test methods using JUnit.

JUnit is a popular Java testing framework used to write and run unit tests.
It helps developers verify that individual parts (units) of their code work correctly by providing annotations, assertions, and test runners.
JUnit is commonly used with Maven and integrates with many Java tools and IDEs.

TestNG is a Java testing framework inspired by JUnit but designed to be more flexible and powerful.
It supports advanced features like test configuration, parallel execution, data-driven testing, and grouping of tests.
TestNG is commonly used for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing in Java projects.

TestNG uses a configuration file named testng.xml for advanced test setup (groups, suites, parameters, etc.).


In pom.xml, POM stands for "Project Object Model." - it is the fundamental configuration file for a Maven project, describing the project's structure, dependencies, build settings, and more.


In Java and Selenium testing, "POM" can mean two things:

In Maven, POM stands for Project Object Model (the pom.xml file).
In Selenium, POM stands for Page Object Model, a design pattern for organizing UI test code.
The meaning depends on the context:

pom.xml → Project Object Model (Maven)
Selenium test code structure → Page Object Model


Run the cucumber runner in dry-run mode - to validate that features and steps are defined and match, without executing interactions.
